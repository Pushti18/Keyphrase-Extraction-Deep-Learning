# Keyphrase-Extraction-Deep-Learning

This project focuses on extracting keywords from text using Spark NLP, an open-source library built on top of Apache Spark and Spark ML. The keyword extraction is performed through the Yake! algorithm, a feature-based system for multi-lingual keyword extraction that does not rely on dictionaries or corpora.

Automated keyword extraction is essential in handling the increasing complexity and volume of textual data. The extracted keywords can be used for various purposes such as document indexing, summarization, categorization, tagging, and search engine optimization. This project provides a practical guide on implementing keyword extraction using Spark NLP and Yake! in a Python environment.

Tools and Libraries
Spark NLP: An open-source library maintained by John Snow Labs, providing performant and accurate NLP annotation for machine learning pipelines on Apache Spark.
Yake!: A novel feature-based system for multi-lingual keyword extraction, designed to work without dictionaries or corpora, making it applicable to diverse languages and domains.
Python: The programming language used for implementing the keyword extraction process.
Pandas: A data manipulation library in Python, used for organizing and displaying the extracted keyword results.

Implementation Steps
Installation: Install Spark NLP and PySpark

This project demonstrates a practical approach to keyword extraction using Spark NLP and the Yake! algorithm. The resulting keywords can be valuable for various applications, enhancing the efficiency of document processing and information retrieval.
